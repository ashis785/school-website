                            education is characterized by a student-centered approach, where learners are actively
                            engaged in the learning process, encouraged to ask questions, and supported to explore their
                            interests and passions. It is a continuous process that requires ongoing evaluation and
                            improvement to ensure that learners are receiving the best possible education. Let's work
                            together to provide quality educat.</p>
